# Crowdfunding-Project


Based upon the data provided, crowdfunding campaigns tend to be successful more often than not. The category of “theater” has the highest success rate compared to other parent categories. “Plays” in particular jumps out with a high success rate. The data represents several countries, while excluding others. This limits the true possible scope of what crowdfunding across a larger demographic looks like. Additional graphs and charts showing how the “goals” and pledged values work together would provide a distinct view of how a goal amount can affect the outcome of the campaign.
